				<p>
					Both the circuit schematic and board layout of the PCB were created on Autodesk EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor). <br><br>A LM358 operational amplifier was used to compare voltages at nodes 2 and 3 in the circuit (refer to the circuit schematic below). Based on the properties of operational amplifiers, we know that the input terminals (nodes 2 and 3) have a high impedance/resistance and therefore ideally there will be no current flowing into the input terminals. This creates a voltage divider and the op amp is able to ouptut a high/low voltage at node 1 depending on whether the voltage at input terminal 3 is lower/higher than input terminal 2. <br><br>
					<ul class = "shift">
						<li>If the Voltage at terminal 3 > Voltage at terminal 2, the output voltage at terminal 1 will rise.</li>
						<li>Otherwise if the Voltage at terminal 3 < Voltage at terminal 2, the output voltage at terminal 1 will drop.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>The values for R1, R2, R3 were chosen as 15K Ω each. <br>In the presence of light, the photoresistor (labeled PHOTO1), had a measured resistance of about 2.5K Ω. <br>In the absence of light, the photoresistor had a measured resistance of about 39K Ω. <br><br>

					If we do some simple voltage division, the voltage at terminal 2 should always measure 4.5 Volts. <br><br>

					In the presence of light, we can calculate the voltage at terminal 3 as 9 V * 2.5K Ω / (15K Ω + 2.5K Ω) ≈ 1.3 Volts. Since 1.3 Volts < 4.5 Volts, the ouptut voltage at terminal 1 will drop resulting in a decreased current flow through the LED and therefore turning it off.<br><br>
					In the absence of light, we can calculate the voltage at terminal 3 as 9 V * 39K Ω / (15K Ω + 39K Ω) ≈ 6.3 Volts.
					Since 6.3 Volts > 4.5 Volts, the output voltage at terminal 1 will rise resulting in an increased current flow through the LED and therefore turning it on.<br>
